This project is a collaborative data analysis and machine learning exercise focused on the Titanic survival dataset. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, the project explores the data, performs preprocessing, builds predictive models, and evaluates their performance.

The repository includes all datasets used, along with a notebook that documents the full workflow from exploration to prediction.
